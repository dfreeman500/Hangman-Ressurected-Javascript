                <p><h4>Welcome to my simple hangman game! Most internet hangman games have the user guess the computer's word. 
                    But in this game "I" will try to guess your word. The goal is to guess any and all English words in as few guesses as possible ... 
                    but that's pretty difficult. Think of a word and enter how long the word is in the box above. I will then try to guess your word by 
                    choosing the most likely letters from the set of words I have in my lists. Along the way, you'll see what words the list are 
                    candidates and which are eliminated. You can click on some of the words to get a definition. </h4></p>
